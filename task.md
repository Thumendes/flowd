# **Title: Building a Secure Login System with TypeScript, Prisma, and Next.js**

### Task Description: Create a Login System Using TypeScript, Prisma, and Next.js

**Objective:**
Develop a secure and efficient login system for a web application using TypeScript, Prisma, and Next.js. The system should allow users to authenticate using their credentials and manage user sessions effectively.

**Requirements:**

1. **Setup Next.js Project:**
   - Initialize a new Next.js project with TypeScript support.
   - Install necessary dependencies, including Prisma and any authentication libraries (e.g., NextAuth.js or custom JWT implementation).

2. **Database Configuration:**
   - Set up a PostgreSQL or SQLite database (or any preferred database).
   - Use Prisma to define the user model in the schema (e.g., fields for email, password, and any other relevant user information).
   - Run Prisma migrations to create the necessary tables in the database.

3. **User Registration:**
   - Create a registration page where users can sign up by providing their email and password.
   - Implement form validation to ensure valid input.
   - Hash passwords securely before storing them in the database using a library like bcrypt.

4. **Login Functionality:**
   - Develop a login page where users can enter their credentials.
   - Implement authentication logic to verify user credentials against the database.
   - Handle login errors gracefully and provide feedback to users.

5. **Session Management:**
   - Implement session management to keep users logged in after authentication.
   - Use cookies or JWT tokens to manage user sessions securely.
   - Ensure that session data is stored and retrieved correctly.

6. **User Experience:**
   - Design a user-friendly interface for the login and registration forms.
   - Provide clear error messages for failed login attempts or registration issues.
   - Optionally, implement features like "Remember Me" for persistent sessions.

7. **Security Considerations:**
   - Ensure that all sensitive data is transmitted over HTTPS.
   - Implement measures to prevent common security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
   - Consider implementing rate limiting on login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.

8. **Testing:**
   - Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the login functionality works as expected.
   - Test edge cases, such as incorrect passwords, existing email during registration, and session expiration.

9. **Documentation:**
   - Document the code and provide clear instructions on how to set up and run the project.
   - Include information on how to configure the database and any environment variables required for the application.

**Deliverables:**
- A fully functional login system integrated into a Next.js application.
- Source code hosted in a version control system (e.g., GitHub).
- Documentation outlining the setup process and usage instructions.

**Timeline:**
Estimate the time required to complete each component of the task and set a deadline for the overall project completion.

This task will help you gain hands-on experience with TypeScript, Prisma, and Next.js while building a critical feature for web applications.

## Steps

Here are the detailed steps to create a login system using TypeScript, Prisma, and Next.js, following the task description provided:

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Setup Next.js Project
   - **Initialize Project:**
     ```bash
     npx create-next-app@latest my-login-system --typescript
     cd my-login-system
     ```
   - **Install Dependencies:**
     ```bash
     npm install prisma @prisma/client next-auth bcrypt
     ```
   - **Initialize Prisma:**
     ```bash
     npx prisma init
     ```

#### 2. Database Configuration
   - **Configure Database:**
     - Open `prisma/schema.prisma` and set up your database connection (PostgreSQL or SQLite).
     ```prisma
     datasource db {
       provider = "postgresql" // or "sqlite"
       url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
     }
     ```
   - **Define User Model:**
     ```prisma
     model User {
       id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
       email     String   @unique
       password  String
       createdAt DateTime @default(now())
     }
     ```
   - **Run Migrations:**
     ```bash
     npx prisma migrate dev --name init
     ```

#### 3. User Registration
   - **Create Registration Page:**
     - Create a new file `pages/register.tsx`.
   - **Implement Form Validation:**
     - Use a library like `react-hook-form` for form handling and validation.
   - **Hash Passwords:**
     - Use `bcrypt` to hash passwords before saving them to the database.
     ```typescript
     import bcrypt from 'bcrypt';

     const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
     ```

#### 4. Login Functionality
   - **Create Login Page:**
     - Create a new file `pages/login.tsx`.
   - **Authentication Logic:**
     - Verify user credentials against the database.
     ```typescript
     const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { email } });
     const isValidPassword = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);
     ```
   - **Handle Errors:**
     - Provide user feedback for failed login attempts.

#### 5. Session Management
   - **Implement Session Management:**
     - Use NextAuth.js or JWT for session management.
   - **Store Session Data:**
     - Configure session storage in `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts` if using NextAuth.js.

#### 6. User Experience
   - **Design Forms:**
     - Use CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap for styling.
   - **Error Messages:**
     - Display clear error messages for user actions (e.g., invalid login).

#### 7. Security Considerations
   - **Use HTTPS:**
     - Ensure your application is served over HTTPS in production.
   - **Prevent Vulnerabilities:**
     - Use prepared statements with Prisma to prevent SQL injection.
     - Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS.
   - **Rate Limiting:**
     - Implement rate limiting on login attempts using middleware.

#### 8. Testing
   - **Write Tests:**
     - Use Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration tests.
   - **Test Edge Cases:**
     - Ensure tests cover scenarios like incorrect passwords and existing emails.

#### 9. Documentation
   - **Document Code:**
     - Use JSDoc or similar for inline documentation.
   - **Setup Instructions:**
     - Create a `README.md` file with setup instructions, including database configuration and environment variables.

### Deliverables
- A fully functional login system integrated into a Next.js application.
- Source code hosted on GitHub or another version control system.
- Comprehensive documentation outlining setup and usage instructions.

### Timeline Estimation
- **Setup Next.js Project:** 1 day
- **Database Configuration:** 1 day
- **User Registration:** 2 days
- **Login Functionality:** 2 days
